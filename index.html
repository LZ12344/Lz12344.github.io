        <h2>Did you know?</h2>
        <p> Bananas Are Berries: Botanically speaking, bananas are berries, while strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are not. This is because berries develop from a single flower with one ovary, and bananas fit this criteria.
            <br><br>Octopuses Have Three Hearts: These fascinating creatures have three hearts: two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body.
            <br><br>Honey Never Spoils: Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's low moisture content and acidic pH create an inhospitable environment for bacteria and other microorganisms.
            <br><br> The Eiffel Tower Can Be 15 cm Taller in Summer: Due to thermal expansion, the iron structure of the Eiffel Tower expands when it's hot, making it taller during the summer months.
            <br><br>Penguins Have Knees: Despite their appearance, penguins do have knees. They are just located inside their bodies, making their legs appear shorter.
            <br><br>Cows Have Best Friends: Cows can form close bonds with other cows, and they often have preferred companions that they like to spend time with.
            <br><br> The Smell of Freshly Cut Grass is a Plant's Distress Call: When grass is cut or damaged, it releases a chemical compound called green leaf volatiles, which acts as a distress signal to neighboring plants to prepare for potential danger.
            <br><br> The Unicorn is the National Animal of Scotland: Scotland's national animal is the mythical unicorn. It was chosen because, in Celtic mythology, the unicorn symbolizes purity, innocence, masculinity, and power.
            <br><br>The World's Largest Desert is Antarctica: While deserts are often associated with hot, sandy environments, a desert is technically defined by its low precipitation levels. Antarctica is the largest desert on Earth, covering an area of over 14 million square kilometers.
            <br><br>A Group of Ferrets is Called a Business: When several ferrets are gathered together, they are referred to as a business. This term likely originated from the Latin word "busyness," which described their active and playful nature.
